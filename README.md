This is my package that houses functions I find myself frequently using.
I am also using this package to learn about building flexible and robust
packages\!

The name `kowr` is my nickname, Kow, with my favorite letter, R\! This
combination makes the package sound like cower, however, I like to think
this package does not derive fear :)

To learn how to set up the add-in `Back to Forward Slash` please
reference the vignette.

## Installation

Download from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("KoderKow/kowr")
